# icos
used the OpenGL graphics API to create and display a three-dimensional
image of a 20-sided Icosahedron. The Icosahedron is the largest possible Platonic Solid figure. All faces of the
Icosahedron are equliateral triangles, with 5 triangles meeting at each vertex. The Icosahedron has a total of 12
vertices. The project skeleton code provides you with the three-dimensional vertex points, and a list of the vertices for
each of the equlateral triangles. In this set of vertices, each vertex is exactly one unit from the 0,0,0 point, which is the
center of the Icosahedron.
